								<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
								<p>My programming journey began my senior year of high school when I decided to take a computer 
									science class for fun. I have always loved the idea of being able to design and build my 
									own projects (sparked by my LEGO obsession as a child), so I thought
									the class would be a great fit for me. I ended up loving it, so 
									I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas after I graduated.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									During my first couple years of university, I continued to develop my programming skills through the 
									classes I was taking as well as working on my own small projects on the side. During my senior 
									year I started interning at a fintech startup called Intellmind where I learned more about
									full-stack web development, cloud computing, and working in a team. I then went on to pass my AWS Cloud Practitioner 
									certification to become more educated about the cloud computing fundamentals. 
								</p>
								<p>
									My goals are to continue learning more about full-stack development and cloud computing so that 
									I can eventually land a  full-time role as a software engineer. I have also become interested in 
									machine learning, so I'm looking forward to working on some personal projects in that field as well.
								</p>
